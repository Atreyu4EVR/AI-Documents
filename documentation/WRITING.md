## Executive Summary

### Problem

Over the past 60+ years, extensive research has been conducted on understanding and improving writing instruction. However, despite these efforts, a significant challenge remains: the lack of scalable solutions to help college graduates meet the standards of written proficiency.

### Vision

We envision a future where technology complements human authorship, making writing more accessible while maintaining its essential role in developing critical thinking and communication skills. Appropriately harnessed, AI-enhanced writing environments can enhance the writing process and make it more fluid, democratic, and inclusive. Strategically deployed, AI can lower the cognitive and motivational barriers that have stood in the way of scaling writing education.

### Approach

Our approach builds on research-based principles that form the foundation for integrating technology both for writing and writing instruction in ways that enhance, rather than replace, human authorship. Our approach focuses on:

- Supporting writers as they translate notes into prose without adding new ideas; the writer maintains control of the ideas but with a reduced cognitive load for exploring how they can be linguistically realized.
- Enhancing the iterative process of drafting and reviewing by making the writer’s invisible composing decisions visible.
- Helping instructors and administrators develop writing assignments and assignment sequences with an integrated library of writing genres.

By strategically integrating AI with research-based approaches, we aim to bridge the long-standing scalability gap in writing instruction while maintaining the thoughtful engagement that characterizes meaningful human writing.

## Introduction

According to psychologist Steven Pinker, "writing is and always has been hard" compared to speech. In conversation, listeners are present and identifiable; in writing, readers are often "unknown, invisible, [and] inscrutable." Since writers are displaced from their readers in time and space, they must convey context through their ability to anticipate mutual and unshared knowledge with their readers using their linguistic know-how.

To organize this anticipatory knowledge and know-how strategically, writing involves many integrated cognitive, social-cognitive, and linguistic processes, including attention, motor, visual, executive functioning, memory, and language, as well as writing knowledge, processes, and skills. These interconnected processes involve the writer’s cognitive resources to function alone and cooperatively. They also compete. For example, with finite time to deadlines, attention to sentence production, grammar, and spelling deducts time from planning and organization, and vice versa.

Despite these challenges, the rewards of writing are significant. Writing endows communication with extended planning time across multiple sittings, creating the capacity to take language “offline” without conversational constraints. The unconstrained time to plan with language affords a refinement of thought unobtainable in unplanned speech or conversation. However, writing tasks can quickly exhaust the writer’s cognitive resources, making writers feel overwhelmed and their capacities overextended. This cognitive burden gives rise to a fundamental motivational problem: when a task is as challenging as writing, the time to learn to manage it and the effort to execute it must be justified. Edmondson characterizes writing as “back-breaking,” “mind-breaking,” and “lonely.” This is why writing researchers and educators across K-12 and post-secondary education have long understood that instruction in writing has small odds of success without addressing students’ motivation to write.

### Disconnect Between Writing Research and Student Performance

Significant research has been conducted on writing processes and effective writing instruction since the 1970s. However, the number of scientifically controlled studies that have identified effective writing instruction is "slim," and the results of these few studies are inconsistent. Nonetheless, there are some practices with consistent benefits that teachers, unfortunately, are not systematically implementing in K-12 classrooms. The most constructive of these practices is to ask students to write more frequently in class.

Several studies across these grades have replicated that giving students more time to write in class improves writing quality, reading comprehension, and subject matter learning. However, in a study published in 2011, Applebee and Langer found that U.S. middle school and high school students were writing only 1.6 pages of prose per week and 2.1 pages for the rest of their subjects combined. Moreover, this scant writing consisted mainly of summary rather than more complex analytic writing. This lack of challenging writing assignments in American classrooms is attributed to workload issues—the more writing, the more feedback burdens on the teacher. The lack of writing practice helps to explain why less than 25% of eighth and 12th-grade American students scored “proficient” in writing.

This problem cascades to the post-secondary level. Beyond a lack of practice in classroom writing, there have been no scalable breakthrough solutions for helping college graduates and young professionals improve their writing. Complaints from employers about the poor quality of college graduate writing registered in the 1964 issue of Harvard Business Review still register today. The modern workplace outputs endless streams of emails and reports, and businesses continue to invest billions of dollars in remedial writing training for their employees.

### The Past of Writing

Writing has continuously evolved over history to lighten the burden of writers based on the emerging technologies that underlie it. The invention of papers, pens, and inks liberated writing from the earlier methods involving inscriptions on clay tablets or bones. To lure professionals away from longhand, the Remington Typewriter Company in the 1870s promised speed and mechanical standardization: “To save time,” their advertising pitched, “is to lengthen life.” In 1985, the New York Times technology columnist Peter Lewis reviewed a new generation of word processors, “each promising to transform a personal computer and printer into a magical super typewriter.”

Until recently, much of the drudge eliminated by writing technologies has had to do with increasing the speed and accuracy of placing marks on the page or screen. Typewriters supported the mechanical transfer of characters on a physical page. Digital technologies began to detect and correct common errors automatically at the word and phrase level, from spelling to grammar. Machine learning introduced automatic completion and text prediction.

As newly invented writing technologies promise to cut transcription time, they often face backlash, typically the unsubstantiated fear that lightening the labor of the writing process somehow degrades the authenticity and quality of the written product. For example, University of Delaware professor Marcia Peoples Halio observed that students using “user-friendly” Macintosh computers “committed more punctuation, spelling and grammar errors … and wrote shorter, less complex sentences.” The notion that easing the transcription costs of writing degrades it is a recurring trope extending back to earlier writing technologies. Still, over time, the newer technology gradually seeps into the general public as a superior extension of the technology it seeks to disrupt: the quill as the superior reed pen, the typewriter as the superior quill, and the word processor as the superior typewriter. As the technology matures and generations turn over, according to Baron, the new technology becomes the new focal lens from which to view, even assimilate the older technologies.

### Emergence of Generative AI

The recent surge of generative AI marks a significant watershed in the evolution of writing technologies and the writing process. Throughout the history of writing tools, technology has focused on improving the efficiency and convenience of transcription. Generative AI is the first technological breakthrough that promises to accelerate not just the transcription of words but the generation of ideas. Before generative AI, writers had to supply the draft for the automated tools to review. Generative AI promises to assist in the production of the draft, along with the tools to review it. Because it appears to intrude on the human and creative aspects of writing, generative AI has stirred much discussion and consternation.

No sooner had generative AI startled the world in the fall of 2022 than social commentators issued dire predictions that AI would deprive rising generations of the intellectual and emotional growth that writing affords. They predicted epidemics of fraudulent authorship, the erosion of critical thinking, the dissolution of academic integrity, the widening of equity gaps, the weakening of human connection, the homogenization of writing, and an onslaught of unprecedented ethical dilemmas.

While these concerns are real and persist today, they frame the relationship between human writers and AI as adversarial. At the same time, many writing instructors have pursued a complementary relationship between AI and writing. Some suggest that AI poses no serious threat to writing assignments when teachers keep their assignments detailed and customized. Others have devised engaging writing assignments integrating generative AI as objects of reflection for students’ critical thinking.

### Next Steps

This white paper presents a forward-looking vision of the future of writing that embraces technologies, including AI, without dehumanizing the writing process. In particular, instead of focusing on what current AI may or may not be or what future technologies can or cannot do, we are interested in what the future of writing ought to be and how technologies should play a productive role in that future.

We envision a future where technology will complement human authorship by granting writers more time to reflect on the intentionality and accountabilities of their composing choices. We envision a future where technology will broaden access to diverse populations of human writers, who, unlike machines, uniquely understand the immediate, personal, and historical context in which they seek to express themselves. We envision a future where technology will become a supportive partner in the development of critical thinking, which is fundamental to human learning. We believe that technology-enhanced writing tools, designed and deployed thoughtfully and strategically, can enhance our ability to write without displacing the human writer from the helm.

Moreover, we aspire to a broader learning and training ecosystem where technologies empower instructors across disciplines and professions to design and implement more effective writing assignments, enable program administrators to analyze writing development patterns across the curriculum, and allow institutions to scale writing instruction without compromising quality or increasing labor. Through innovative AI-enhanced tools and data-driven insights, we see opportunities to scale writing instruction to a broad spectrum of courses—from first-year composition courses to advanced courses in the disciplines, from community college courses focusing on workplace writing skills to corporate and executive training courses. We believe that meaningful advancement in writing must support not just individual writers, but the entire community of educators and administrators who guide and sustain writing education, helping students and professionals become life-long learners of writing.

## The Threat to Writing “Thoughtfully” in the Age of AI

Writing is a thoughtful activity. It affords the opportunity to think things through, make decisions, learn about and solve problems, coax insight from data, calm situations, or disrupt them. All writing—from academic to workplace—requires thoughtfulness, often captured in the expression “critical thinking.” Critical thinking is the ability to comprehend, explore, organize, and express complex ideas, sift, synthesize, and evaluate evidence, and apply this accumulated knowledge to construct and refute reasoned arguments across disciplines and subject matter domains.

Critical thinking, in this sense, spans both a method of inquiry and a means of discovery, helping writers clarify their thinking and apply that clarity to engage iteratively and deeply with the material they are working with. In educational settings, the development of critical thinking often occurs organically within writing assignments in specific disciplines. These assignments prompt students to analyze disciplinary concepts, evaluate evidence, and construct well-reasoned arguments, fostering writing proficiency and deepening their critical thinking capabilities within their field.

The future of writing with AI must not conflate the thoughtful engagement of the writer, which is indispensable, with the human toil that is dispensable and that machines can mitigate. In other words, at every reasonable opportunity, AI must ensure that the writer’s thoughtfulness is sustained and never buried under or distracted by layers of toil.

What makes writing human has never been solely or even essentially about the arrangement of words on the page or screen. It has more to do with who stands behind those words, who stakes their reputation on them, and who is willing to defend every composing decision. Authorial decision-making is more complex and requires more thoughtful engagement than sequencing words. As machines increasingly become capable of the generative aspects of writing, it is critical for human authors to own the decision-making behind the actions of their machine. Ownership of composing decisions has been a goal of writing education since its inception. However, the cognitive demands of writing can easily obstruct novice writers’ development of ownership over their composing choices and even their awareness that decisions are being made.

We propose an ethical approach to AI that allows writers to convert their paragraph-size notes, representing their ideas, into readable grammatical sentences without changing or expanding on the meaning of the notes. This assistance helps writers rapidly prototype/evaluate their thinking by wrapping a readable syntax or visual format around it. This assistance requires restraining the AI to minimize the potential distraction of extrapolating beyond the notes or even hallucinating. Limiting the production unit to a paragraph or less ensures that the writer can quickly spot unwanted extrapolations or hallucinations should they arise. More importantly, this approach further alleviates the ‘creep’ of sentence craft—a threat to the writer’s sustained thoughtful engagement—where writers tend to leap ahead to the final stages of sentence polishing, even when ideas remain fluid and sentence polish is premature.

## Challenges of Writing in Higher Education

Writing instruction in higher education has evolved significantly to address its fundamental purpose—developing writers who can adapt and continue learning about writing throughout their lives. The path to achieving this lifelong learning capacity differs between institutional contexts. Four-year institutions emphasize disciplinary variations and introduction of theoretical frameworks for transfer. In contrast, two-year colleges must balance multiple urgent needs: preparing students for transfer, developing workplace writing skills, and addressing basic writing needs within compressed timeframes.

Despite these contextual differences, three critical objectives unite contemporary writing instruction to foster this lifelong learning capacity:

- **Develop students’ ability to participate effectively in academic and professional discourse communities**, teaching them to understand and engage with the conventions, expectations, and genres specific to different fields.
- **Build students’ capacity to analyze and respond to diverse contexts of writing**, enabling them to recognize how purpose, audience, and context shape effective communication.
- **Cultivate metacognitive awareness about writing choices and their effects**, helping students understand not just how to write, but why certain strategies are effective in particular situations.

These interconnected goals reflect the Boyer Commission’s vision of undergraduate education and align with the contemporary understanding of writing as a complex social and cognitive activity. By focusing on these elements rather than merely teaching prescribed forms or rules, writing instruction prepares students to navigate the diverse writing challenges they will encounter throughout their academic, professional, and personal lives.

However, despite decades of research and evolving pedagogical approaches, two fundamental issues—the cognitive complexity of writing and the challenge of skills transfer across contexts—remain central challenges for writing instruction. Understanding these challenges across different types of institutions and advances in research to address them provides crucial context for examining the future of technology-enhanced approaches in writing instruction.

## Principles Central to Addressing the Writing Problem

Our strategy for tackling the challenge of writing revolves around the following core principles, which are firmly grounded in empirical research on writing pedagogy and cognitive processes. These research-derived principles inform our approach to designing effective writing tools for students and writers:

### Principle 1: Cognitive Load Reduction Enhances Writer Engagement

High cognitive load can overwhelm working memory. Reducing the load frees up cognitive resources to hold on to the big picture while fine-tuning sentences, improves problem-solving and enhances motivation and engagement. Across the many cognitive components of the writing process, empirical research suggests that translation and transcription are a noteworthy Achilles’ heel.

### Principle 2: Extended Prewriting Activity Is Essential

Prewriting activities, including brainstorming, outlining, and note-taking, help writers develop and organize their ideas. Generating effective writing requires significant allocations of time for planning and organization. However, prewriting time often inadvertently slips away in competition with other later processes.

### Principle 3: Genre Knowledge Provides Critical Scaffolding for Writing Activities

Genre-specific knowledge ensures direction and focus in developing well-formed writing. Genre knowledge allows writers to pin down the expectations of readers, the conventions, tropes, linguistic structures, and author-reader relationships that readers expect to encounter. Genre, in this sense, guides the entire writing process: prewriting, sentence-generating, and revising.

### Principle 4: Review and Revision Are Integral Components of the Writing Process Essential for Effective Writing

Writing often requires an iterative process through multiple drafts. Throughout the writing process, writers must review the draft carefully from various perspectives, including consistency, coverage of topics, flow of ideas, persuasiveness of arguments, appropriateness of the voice/tone, etc.

### Principle 5: Explicit Instruction in Metacognitive Writing Strategies Facilitates the Grasp of Threshold Concepts

Research highlights the crucial role of metacognitive awareness in writing development. Teaching metacognitive strategies can promote both near and far transfer, helping students understand fundamental concepts about writing while developing their ability to consciously recognize and apply their knowledge across contexts.

### Principle 6: Meaningful Sequencing of Writing Assignments Within and Across Courses Supports Transfer

Assignment sequencing is critical in fostering writing knowledge across academic contexts. Carefully sequenced assignments, particularly those building in systematic reflection, can significantly enhance students’ ability to transfer writing knowledge across contexts.

### Principle 7: Support for Disciplinary Instructors in Developing and Assessing Writing Assignments Strengthens Pedagogical Practice

Supporting instructors in the disciplines to develop engaging and meaningful writing assignments, as well as to support them in assessing writing assignments, is critical. This support must be systematic and sustained, focusing on helping faculty understand writing pedagogy within their disciplines and on developing effective strategies for both designing and assessing writing assignments.

## Future of Writing & Writing Instruction—Our Approach

For the past twenty-five years, guided by some of these principles, we have explored how digital tools incorporating Natural Language Processing and interactive visualization might alleviate writers’ cognitive load and enhance their writing process. These experimental digital writing environments were designed to offer automatic feedback, thereby maintaining a writer’s engagement without the need for supervision from teachers.

Our involvement in this research long predates the rise of generative AI. At the same time, we have discovered that strategic deployment of generative AI complements our vision of placing the human writer at the forefront of the writing process while democratizing access to the writing process for a broader population.

### Restrained Generative AI

Early drafting is often painful because it takes place in a mental fog. Writers usually cannot understand their preliminary thoughts until they see them realized as sentences. One responsible use of AI offers writers a tool to convert their notes into prose without adding ideas. The AI is restrained to mirror in prose the quality of the writer’s notes. The AI ensures that the sentences produced stay within the bounds of the human writer’s original ideas. Restrained generative AI creates language to help writers rapidly prototype and test notes on their paragraph-sized ideas and organization.

Restrained generative AI can narrow the psychological distance between ideas and expression and relax the bottlenecks that have kept them siloed. It can make writing more fluid while reducing pain points. It can make the writing process accessible and more inclusive, particularly for underprivileged students with limited access to writing instruction, as well as second-language learners.

### Restrained Analytic AI

Evaluation in the review/revision process is a complex and constructive activity that builds on reading comprehension. AI has the potential to do much of this metacognitive bookkeeping in the review process, but only if it is guided to do so. Instead of relying solely on AI’s training knowledge alone to assess the quality of the writing, we can guide the AI based on research findings on what makes writing more effective for a specific writing type.

### Making the Invisible Visible

Visualizing invisible features of writing, such as key points, lines of argument, coherence relations, and the information density of sentences, can significantly enhance the writer’s ability to review and revise their drafts. Visualizing these features at a glance through AI promises to ease time-consuming monitoring activities, including reading, re-reading, skimming, and scanning.

### Tools to Think With

Developing metacognitive awareness in writing presents a significant challenge in composition pedagogy, particularly because expert writing practices often involve implicit knowledge that remains invisible to novice writers. Computational environments serve as cognitive scaffolds by providing multiple analytical perspectives on texts, from visualizations of argument and topical development to persuasive strategies. By interacting with these concrete representations of their own writing, students can develop mental models for understanding and approaching the writing process.

### Connecting the Genres

Implementing thoughtful sequencing at scale across college curricula remains challenging. One promising approach is to develop a digital library of genres that could support computational analysis of academic assignments. Mapping relationships between genres allows us to inform how assignments across courses and curricula can be sequenced to support students’ transfer of writing knowledge.

### Support Instructors & TAs

Disciplinary faculty often develop writing assignments with minimal formal support in writing pedagogy. To support instructors in developing and assessing writing assignments, we envision an integrated technology-based solution with multiple components, including a comprehensive library of writing genres with clearly defined expectations, intelligent assignment selection, and AI-enhanced review tools.

## Conclusion

The advent of AI yields new opportunities to distinguish the human essentials of authorship from the bookkeeping and overhead that machines can handle. AI does not make writing “easier” in the sense of eliminating the human challenge. AI instead makes writing more “effective” by focusing on the actions of writing that can only be entrusted to a human and offloading non-central bookkeeping actions to a machine.

AI promises to help more of the human race enjoy the fulfillment of expressing themselves and the world in which they cohabit through the written word. Decades of research on writing have helped us understand the challenges of writing and improved ways to teach and motivate it. By making the writing process more effective and satisfying for human beings, we will likely see the gap closing between all we have learned from research and student and workplace performance.

We have suggested that no responsible AI should intrude on the human writer’s critical decision-making, judgment, reflection, and accountability. This means that in the future of writing, authorship will have less to do with who “produced” the prose and more to do with who takes accountability for it. Those accountabilities require both extreme craft knowledge and analytic knowledge. The writing of the future will require humans to have a more rigorous and systematic knowledge of what makes writing human. With greater machine assistance on the small and routine aspects of writing, writers of the future will have more time to reflect on their subtle messaging strategies and the likely impact on audiences receiving them.

Moreover, strategic integration of AI and computational approaches to writing transfer at programmatic levels promises to help bridge the long-standing scalability gap in writing instruction. By providing data-driven frameworks for understanding genre relationships and enabling more coherent sequencing of writing experiences across disciplines, these tools can help institutions implement research-based practices at scale. This multi-level approach—supporting individual writers while providing tools for institutional coordination—creates opportunities to meaningfully connect classroom instruction with broader curricular goals.

For over half a century, we have witnessed recurrent calls to improve the writing skills of students and professionals. While these have been well-meaning efforts to signal the problem, we have not seen scalable solutions that can effectively support writing development for large numbers of students and writers. Emerging computational technologies, including what we now call AI, offer an opportunity to develop such solutions and shape the future of writing. However, we believe the path forward requires writing experts to lead with a clear vision for writing and instruction—instead of waiting for technologies to chart the course.
