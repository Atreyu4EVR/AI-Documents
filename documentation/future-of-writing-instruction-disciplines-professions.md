## Executive Summary

### Problem
Over the past 60+ years, extensive research has been conducted on understanding and improving writing instruction. However, despite these efforts, a significant challenge remains: the lack of scalable solutions to help college graduates meet the standards of written proficiency.

### Vision
We envision a future where technology complements human authorship, making writing more accessible while maintaining its essential role in developing critical thinking and communication skills. Appropriately harnessed, AI-enhanced writing environments can enhance the writing process and make it more fluid, democratic, and inclusive. Strategically deployed, AI can lower the cognitive and motivational barriers that have stood in the way of scaling writing education.

### Approach
Our approach builds on research-based principles that form the foundation for integrating technology both for writing and writing instruction in ways that enhance rather than replace human authorship. Our approach focuses on:
- Supporting writers as they translate notes into prose without adding new ideas; the writer maintains control of the ideas but with a reduced cognitive load for exploring how they can be linguistically realized.
- Enhancing the iterative process of drafting and reviewing by making the writer’s invisible composing decisions visible.
- Helping instructors and administrators develop writing assignments and assignment sequences with an integrated library of writing genres.

By strategically integrating AI with research-based approaches, we aim to bridge the long-standing scalability gap in writing instruction while maintaining the thoughtful engagement that characterizes meaningful human writing.

## Introduction

Steven Pinker notes that “writing is and always has been hard” compared to speech. Writers are separated from their readers in time and space, requiring them to anticipate what their readers know and to craft language accordingly. Writing involves many integrated cognitive, social-cognitive, and linguistic processes, such as attention, executive functioning, memory, and language. These processes compete for finite cognitive resources, making writing both rewarding and overwhelming.

### Disconnect Between Writing Research and Student Performance
Despite significant research since the 1970s on writing processes and effective instruction, there have been no scalable breakthrough solutions for helping college graduates and young professionals improve their writing. The most constructive practice—asking students to write more frequently in class—is not systematically implemented. Studies show that U.S. students write very little and are rarely given challenging assignments, leading to less than 25% scoring “proficient” on standardized writing assessments. This problem extends into the workplace, where employers continue to report poor writing skills among college graduates.

### The Past of Writing
Writing technologies have evolved to lighten the burden of writers—from clay tablets to word processors. Each technological advancement, initially met with skepticism, eventually became the new standard. The latest technological leap is generative AI, which can accelerate not just transcription but also the generation of ideas.

### Emergence of Generative AI
Generative AI marks a watershed moment, as it can now produce drafts, not just review them. This has sparked concerns about academic integrity, critical thinking, and the authenticity of writing. Some educators see generative AI as a threat, while others see the potential for AI to complement writing instruction, especially if assignments are detailed and reflective.

### Next Steps
This white paper presents a vision of the future of writing that embraces technology—including AI—without dehumanizing the writing process. We advocate for a future where technology broadens access, supports critical thinking, and empowers instructors and administrators to improve writing instruction at scale.

### The Threat to Writing “Thoughtfully” in the Age of AI
Writing is inherently a thoughtful activity, central to developing critical thinking. The future of writing with AI must ensure that technology does not replace the thoughtful engagement and decision-making that make writing human. Instead, AI should support writers by reducing toil while maintaining human ownership of authorial decisions.

To achieve this, we propose an ethical approach to AI: allowing writers to convert their paragraph-size notes into readable sentences without introducing new ideas, minimizing the risk of AI “hallucinations,” and keeping the writer in control.

## Challenges of Writing in Higher Education

Writing instruction in higher education aims to develop adaptable, lifelong writers. Four-year institutions emphasize disciplinary variations and theoretical frameworks for transfer, while two-year colleges balance transfer preparation, workplace writing skills, and basic writing needs. Three objectives unite writing instruction:

- Participation in academic and professional discourse communities
- Capacity to analyze and respond to diverse writing contexts
- Cultivation of metacognitive awareness about writing choices

Despite decades of research, two fundamental issues persist:
- The cognitive complexity of writing
- The challenge of skills transfer across contexts

Research shows that writing is not a linear process and that skills do not automatically transfer between contexts. Supporting transfer and disciplinary specialization remains a key focus, but effective coordination across curricula is still a challenge.

## Principles Central to Addressing the Writing Problem

Our strategy is built on research-derived principles:

### Principle 1: Cognitive load reduction enhances writer engagement
High cognitive load overwhelms working memory. Reducing it frees up resources for higher-level thinking and enhances motivation. Sentence craft, in particular, often leads writers into “rabbit holes” of revision and distraction.

### Principle 2: Extended prewriting activity is essential
Prewriting activities such as brainstorming and outlining are crucial for developing and organizing ideas. However, drafting often consumes prewriting time due to the cognitive demands of sentence generation.

### Principle 3: Genre knowledge provides critical scaffolding for writing activities
Genre knowledge directs prewriting and drafting, helping writers anticipate reader expectations and conventions.

### Principle 4: Review and revision are integral components of the writing process
Effective writing is iterative. Reviewing and revising drafts from different perspectives (consistency, logic, flow) is essential, yet often neglected due to high cognitive costs.

### Principle 5: Explicit instruction in metacognitive writing strategies facilitates the grasp of threshold concepts
Metacognitive awareness and explicit instruction in key writing concepts are vital for helping students transfer writing skills across contexts.

### Principle 6: Meaningful sequencing of writing assignments within and across courses supports transfer
Sequencing assignments thoughtfully across courses and curricula helps students develop transferable writing skills.

### Principle 7: Support for disciplinary instructors in developing and assessing writing assignments strengthens pedagogical practice
Instructors need systematic support to design effective writing assignments and assessments within their disciplines.

## Future of Writing & Writing Instruction—Our Approach

For 25 years, we have explored how digital tools using Natural Language Processing and visualization can reduce cognitive load and support writing development. The rise of generative AI complements our vision of keeping the human writer at the center and broadening access.

### Restrained Generative AI
AI should help writers turn notes into prose without adding new ideas, mirroring the quality and clarity of the original notes. This supports rapid prototyping and evaluation of ideas, making writing more accessible and inclusive, especially for underprivileged or second-language learners.

### Restrained Analytic AI
AI can also assist in the review and revision process by tracking the development of key ideas, arguments, and coherence—tasks that are labor-intensive for humans. By guiding AI with research-based criteria, it can provide feedback similar to what a composition teacher would offer.

### Making the Invisible Visible
Visualization tools can make abstract or complex features of writing—like argument structure, coherence, or information density—visible and manipulable. This enhances writers’ ability to review and revise drafts effectively.

### Tools to Think With
Interactive, computational tools can help students build mental models of the writing process, supporting the development of metacognitive awareness and key threshold concepts.

### Connecting the Genres
Mapping relationships between genres and assignments across curricula enables more coherent sequencing and supports writing transfer. A digital library of genres can support assignment analysis, reveal learning progressions, and inform curriculum design.

### Support Instructors & TAs
Disciplinary instructors often lack formal training in writing pedagogy. Integrated technology solutions—such as a genre library and AI-enhanced review tools—can help scale writing instruction, provide assignment feedback, and support TA training across disciplines.

## Conclusion

AI offers opportunities to distinguish the human essentials of authorship from mechanical tasks that machines can handle. AI does not make writing easier by eliminating challenge, but by making the process more effective—freeing writers to focus on high-level decisions and critical thinking. The future of writing requires that humans remain accountable for their prose, supported by AI in the routine aspects of writing.

Strategic integration of AI and computational approaches at the programmatic level can help bridge the long-standing gap between writing research and actual student and workplace performance. Emerging technologies offer the potential for scalable solutions to writing instruction, but these advances should be led by experts with a clear vision for writing and instruction.
